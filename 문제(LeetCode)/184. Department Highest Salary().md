```
select D.name as Department, E.name as Employee, E.salary
from Employee E
inner join Department D
on E.DepartmentId = D.Id
where (E.departmentid, E.salary) in
    (
        select departmentid, max(salary)
        from employee
        group by departmentid
    )
```

- 세분화시켜서 풀기.
- `in` 이용

```
select T.Department, T.Employee, T.Salary
from 
(
	select E.name as Employee, E.salary as Salary, D.name as Department,
    dense_rank() over (partition by D.name order by E.salary desc) as R
	from employee E
	inner join department D 
	on E.departmentId = D.id
) as T
where T.R = 1
```

- `partition by` 이용 (group by 처럼 한 항목에만 적용하기 위해서 사용)

```
select T.Department, T.Employee, T.Salary
from 
(
	select E.name as Employee, E.salary as Salary, D.name as Department,
    dense_rank() over (partition by D.name order by E.salary desc) as R
	from employee E
	inner join department D 
	on E.departmentId = D.id
) as T
where T.R = 1
```

- partition by 와 group by를 함께 쓰지 않도록 주의
