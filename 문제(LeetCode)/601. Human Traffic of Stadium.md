``` sql
WITH many_people_stadium AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Stadium
    WHERE people >= 100
)

SELECT distinct id, visit_date, people
FROM (
    SELECT S1.id, S1.visit_date, S1.people
    FROM many_people_stadium S1
    JOIN many_people_stadium S2 ON S1.id = S2.id-1
    JOIN many_people_stadium S3 ON S2.id = S3.id-1

    UNION

    SELECT S2.id, S2.visit_date, S2.people
    FROM many_people_stadium S1
    JOIN many_people_stadium S2 ON S1.id = S2.id-1
    JOIN many_people_stadium S3 ON S2.id = S3.id-1

    UNION

    SELECT S3.id, S3.visit_date, S3.people
    FROM many_people_stadium S1
    JOIN many_people_stadium S2 ON S1.id = S2.id-1
    JOIN many_people_stadium S3 ON S2.id = S3.id-1
) AS T
ORDER BY visit_date
```

- UNION 말고 다른 방법?
